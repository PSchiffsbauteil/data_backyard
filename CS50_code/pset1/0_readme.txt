For the first Problem Set the learners were asked to create 3 different programmes.
The first basic programme (hello.c) asks the user for a name (or string input) and greets the user.
The second programme (cash.c) finds the smallest amount of coins that someone can expect for a given amount of
change, for which the user is queried.
The third programm (mario.c, respective mario_less.c) creates a flight of stairs (represented by hashtags) which
have a height that the user needs to choose after running the programme. The stairs resemble an obstacle in level 1-1 in Super Mario Brothers, hence the name.
