For the first Problem Set the learners were asked to create 3 different programmes.


The first basic programme ([hello.c](https://github.com/PSchiffsbauteil/data_backyard/blob/main/CS50_code/pset1/hello.c "hello")) asks the user for a name (or string input) and greets the user.


The second programme ([cash.c](https://github.com/PSchiffsbauteil/data_backyard/blob/main/CS50_code/pset1/cash.c "cash")) finds the smallest amount of coins that someone can expect for a given amount of change, for which the user is queried.


The third programm ([mario.c](https://github.com/PSchiffsbauteil/data_backyard/blob/main/CS50_code/pset1/mario.c "mario"), respectively [mario_less.c](https://github.com/PSchiffsbauteil/data_backyard/blob/main/CS50_code/pset1/mario_less.c "mario less")) creates a flight of stairs (represented by hashtags) which have a height that the user needs to choose after running the programme. The stairs resemble an obstacle in level 1-1 in Super Mario Brothers, hence the name.
