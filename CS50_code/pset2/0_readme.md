For the second Problem Set two tasks were solved.

The first one ([readability.c](https://github.com/PSchiffsbauteil/data_backyard/blob/main/CS50_code/pset2/readability.c "readability")) was to design a programme which would calculate the Coleman-Liau index for a user input text and display which (US) school grade would be necessary for a person to understand the text.

The second programme ([caesar.c](https://github.com/PSchiffsbauteil/data_backyard/blob/main/CS50_code/pset2/caesar.c "caesar")) can encrypt a given text by adding a certain, user chosen, number to the ascii value of the letters and therefore rotating through the alphabet.
