For the second Problem Set two tasks were solved.
The first one (readability.c) was to design a programme which would calculate the Coleman-Liau index for a user input text and display which (US) school grade would be necessary for a person to understand the text.
The second programme (caesar.c) can encrypt a given text by adding a certain, user chosen, number to the ascii value of the given letters and therefore rotating through the alphabet.
