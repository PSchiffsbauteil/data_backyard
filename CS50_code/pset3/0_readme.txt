For the third Problem Set two voting programmes were written.
The first one (plurality.c) allows the user to enter a number of candidates (names), followed by a query for the amount of voters.
For every voter a name can be entered and finally a winner will be displayed depending on the highest amount of votes.
The second programme runs a runoff election, where each voter ranks their choice from most to least favourite candidate. 
If any candidate has more than half of the votes, they win the election. Otherwise the candidate with the least amount of votes
is eliminated and the remaining candidates compete again until a winner is found or the vote is tied (in which case everybody wins).
