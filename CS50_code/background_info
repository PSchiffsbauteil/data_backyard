The folders in this section of my data backyard hold the programmes i wrote for the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course,
which sadly was interrupted by my masters thesis in Archaeology in June 2020.

Due to the cs50.h library there are "training-wheels" attached to the code, especially regarding strings and promting for user input.
If anyone would want to try the programmes i would suggest using the CS50 sandbox, which recognizes cs50.h:

https://sandbox.cs50.io

The code can be compiled using the 'make' command, which is also a convenience that was integrated for a smoother learning experience.
